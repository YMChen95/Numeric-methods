Exercise 1
part A:
./L1E1A
vectorized implementation is obviously faster than the previous one.

Part B:
./L1E1B

Exercise 2
./lab1E2
The x for textbook's exercise is  
-1
3
-1

, and I uesed my own test data as A=[1,4,2,3;0,1,4,4;-1,0,1,0;2,0,4,1;]
b=[3;6;10;2]
which get the x as
-5.7692
2.6154
4.2308
-3.3846

Exercise 3

part A:
Here is the anwser for using Matlab's build-in LU routine and \ operator
    1.7400
    0.2700
    5.9900
    1.8000
    8.9500
    4.2500
    2.4600
    2.7800
    7.7600

    1.4175
    0.7208
    5.4108
    2.2508
    7.5975
    4.7008
    1.8808
    3.2308
    7.4375
The overdetermined uses more data than using the Matlab's build-in LU routine, so that soulution is better.

Part B:

Part C:
The world is "science"
